# 🔗 Doubly Linked List (OOP C++)

A console-based Doubly Linked List implementation developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project demonstrates how core data-structure operations are built from scratch, without using STL containers.

# 📌 Features

# 🧱 Node Structure
Each node stores:
Data value
Pointer to next node
Pointer to previous node

# ➕ Insertion Operations
Insert at beginning
Insert at end
Insert after a specific node
Insert after a specific index

#❌ Deletion Operations
Delete first node
Delete last node
Delete a specific node by reference
Clear the entire list


# 🔍 Access & Search
Find node by value
Get node by index
Get item value by index
Update item value by index


# 🔄 List Utilities
Reverse the list
Check if list is empty
Get list size
Print list content in readable format


# 🖥️ Console Output
```
Clear visualization of list structure:

NULL <--> 1 <--> 2 <--> 3 <--> NULL
```

Step-by-step testing of all operations in main()

# 🧠 Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Templates (template <class T>)
Dynamic memory allocation (new / delete)
Pointers and references
Encapsulation
Data Structures fundamentals

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
C++
Console-based application
No STL containers (educational purpose)

# 🎯 Educational Purpose
This project is designed to:
Deeply understand how linked lists work internally
Practice pointer manipulation
Build strong foundations for advanced data structures
Prepare for technical interviews and academic courses
